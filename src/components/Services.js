    WE BELIEVE THAT:<br/>
1. The holy bible is the inspired, inerrant and infallible word of God and that
it reveals the will of God to Man. 1 Timothy 3:15-17
<br/>
2. There is only one true God and that Christ is ONE with the father and also
the HOLY the triune Godhead. God is self–revealing and self-existing in
the three divine persons.
<br/>
3. Jesus was born of Virgin and only by hi shed blood through Grace and
Faith can one find salvation. Romans 3:24
<br/>
4. Water baptism is an ordinance of the Church symbolizing to the world one
has died with Jesus and has been raised with him to walk in the
NEWNESS of life. Matthew 28:19, Acts 10:17-48
<br/>
5. The infilling of the holy spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is a
requirement for every believer for POWER AND HOLINESS
<br/>
6. As believers we can receive divine healing and that healing is included in
the atonement. Mark 16:18, Isaiah 53:4-5
<br/>
7. That Holy Spirit empowers men for services and as such they operate
through these gifts of the Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:4-10
<br/>
8. The Lord’s Supper is an ordinance of the church the broken body and the
shed blood of Jesus and is a new covenant between God and Men.
1 Corinthians 11:24-28
<br/>
9. Paying of tithe and offering is a requirement for very believer for the
furtherance of the kingdom and that this is God’s financial plan for the
Church. Leviticus 27:30, Malachi 3:8-11, Luke:6 38
<br/>
10.The great Commission as given to us by our lord also includes loving one
another as Christ loved the church, thus willingly we should support this
by giving our substance, giving ourselves, praying and going out to reach
others for thirst.
<br/>
11.We believe that we shall reign with Jesus in his MILLENIAL KINGDOM and
thus we wait for the blessed hope and appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ. Revelation 19:11-16, Titus2:13
<br/>
12.We believe in the existence of hell and eternal punishment.
<br/>

THIS WE TOTALLY BELIEVE AND AFFIRM .......................................... AMEN
